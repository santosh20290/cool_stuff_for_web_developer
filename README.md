Hi Everyone,
<p>I am Santosh Thakur working as a Web Developer from last 7 years.</p>
<p>I just want to share some cool stuff used while website design or development.</p>

<strong> Point no. 1 </strong>:- I have seen too many developers to waste there important time for creating dummy data. 
just use blind text generator to generate dummy data.This is very usefull when you are creating a website templates.
Even QA team also use this cool stuff while doing website testing
