# cool_stuff_for_web_developer
Hi Everyone,
<p>I am Santosh Thakur working as a Web Developer from last 7 years.</p>
<p>I just want to share some cool stuff used while website design or development.</p>

<strong> Point no. 1 </strong>:- I have seen too many developers to waste there important time for creating dummy data. 
just use blind text generator to generate dummy data.This is very usefull when you are creating a website templates.
Even QA team also use this cool stuff while doing website testing

<strong> Point no. 2</strong>:-A free, open-source API for generating random user data. Like Lorem Ipsum.
As per my experience most of the time getProfile backend API is not available while creating templates.
So there is no need to wait for Backend API.
randomuser provide us data regarding user profiles i.e. random profile picture, name, mobile and other stuff.
They have provided API https://randomuser.me/api/.its open sourse project we can take help of this cool stuff while developing
